## Project 1: Predict Horse Health Outcome

- This project aims to predict the health outcome of horses. The data has been retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22) and is classified as a beginner-level competition.

- In this notebook, you will find various steps detailing my approach to this task:
  - First, I conducted a simple exploratory analysis to identify statistical significance among different features.
  - Next, I incorporated visualizations to uncover hidden insights.
  - Finally, I trained various models to determine the most suitable algorithm for this type of problem.

- It was determined that XGBoost produced the most satisfying results. Since the data lacks inference data for testing, this project relies solely on the split train data for training purposes.
