## Project 1: Predict Horse Health Outcome

- This project aims to predict the health outcome of horses. The data has been retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22) and is classified as a beginner-level competition.

- In this notebook, you will find various steps detailing my approach to this task:
  - First, I conducted a simple exploratory analysis to identify statistical significance among different features.
  - Next, I incorporated visualizations to uncover hidden insights.
  - Finally, I trained various models to determine the most suitable algorithm for this type of problem.

- It was determined that XGBoost produced the most satisfying results. Since the data lacks inference data for testing, this project relies solely on the split train data for training purposes.

## Project 2: Sales Analysis on Power BI
This project is a demonstration of my Power BI proficiency, highlighting various aspects of my skills in data analysis and visualization. The report features a well-structured data model that I meticulously built. Within, you'll encounter diverse measurements, demonstrating my skills in using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). The report also showcases my storytelling ability, weaving insights seamlessly throughout the analysis. Despite the simplicity of the dashboard, it serves as a powerful example of my capabilities with this tool, offering a glimpse into the depth and breadth of my Power BI skills.
